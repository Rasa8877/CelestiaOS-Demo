# VortexOS-Demo

Welcome to **VortexOS-Demo**, a very early, minimal terminal-based operating system prototype written in Python.  
This project is a demonstration of a simple shell environment with custom commands and a built-in text editor — a foundational stepping stone toward a full terminal OS.

---

## Features

- Custom shell prompt with environment variable support  
- Basic commands: `say`, `sv`, `fd`, `ld`, `qw`, `cl`, `dl`, `ed`, `help`, and `exit`  
- Simple built-in text editor powered by `curses`  
- Command autocomplete for commands and file paths  
- Clear screen and file/folder operations  
- Splash screen with version info  

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x  
- Unix-like system or Windows with a terminal supporting curses (Windows may require `windows-curses` package)  

---

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rasa8877/VortexOS-Demo.git
```

2. Change directory:

   ```bash

   ```

3. Run the shell:
